# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Project-using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
This project implements various machine learning algorithms to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on clinical features. The model classifies tumors as either malignant or benign using multiple classification algorithms and compares their performance.

# Features

## Implementation of 7 different machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)


- Performance comparison using accuracy and ROC metrics
- Visualization of model performance using matplotlib
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis

## Dataset
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which includes various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. Each record represents measurements for breast cancer cases and includes information such as:

- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- And other cellular characteristics

## Model Training and Evaluation
The project implements a comprehensive evaluation framework:

- Data splitting into training and test sets
- Model training using multiple algorithms
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and ROC metrics
- Visualization of results using bar and other charts

## Results
The implementation achieves high accuracy across different models:

- Most models achieve accuracy rates above 90%
- ROC-AUC scores demonstrate strong predictive performance
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, GBDT) show particularly robust results
